What is useRef hook?
The useRef is a hook that allows to directly create a reference to the DOM element in the functional component.
The useRef hook is a new addition in React 16.8. To learn useRef the user should be aware about refs in React. 
Unlike useState if we change a value in useRef it will not re-render the webpage  

Reasons to use useRef hook
The main use of useRef hook is to access the DOM elements in a more efficient way as compared to simple refs. 
Since useRef hooks preserve value across various re-renders and do not cause re-renders whenever a value is changed they make 
the application faster and helps in caching and storing previous values

Importing useRef hook
To import the useRef hook, write the following code at the top level of your component
import { useRef } from 'react';
