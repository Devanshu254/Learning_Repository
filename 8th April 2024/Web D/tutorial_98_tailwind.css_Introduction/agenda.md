The main thing about Tailwind CSS is just this that we do not need to create another file like style.css, we will just write our code within html.  

There is a concept of breakpoints in Tailwind CSS.

NPX -> NPX stands for Node Package Execute and it is included with npm. If you install npm above 5.2.0, npx will be installed automatically. It is an npm package runner that can execute any package from the npm registry without ever installing it.

The use of Tailwind CSS is to make the creation of the website fast.
Tailwind CSS makes it easy to make CSS. It is very Easy. 

The classes which we pass and define within our div's we need to define them. But what if we say that, you do not need to define the class. You Just need to write a class within your div and the thing will work successfully.
The Final Code would be production ready code. 
<div class = "container black"> -> HEre we do not need to define black in Tailwind CSS.
    Hey Harry
</div>

Tailwind CSS is a technology in which if we have configured it successfully Then We can use utility classes.

When We install Tailwind CSS we write npm install -D tailwindcss
When we write -D we says as a dev dependency our package is getting installed. Means only the time of development we are trying to use it. The use of this is, when we will deploy our apps in production then this will not become an overhead.

npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
```
