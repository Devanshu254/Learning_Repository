# Why react ?
-> We can use states which means that once we update the state variable, it changes across the page.
-> We can split our app into multiple components and resuse these components.
-> React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM manipulation.
-> Debugging and maintainance becomes very easy.
