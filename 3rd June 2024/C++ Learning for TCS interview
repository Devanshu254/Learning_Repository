1. What is C++? What are the advantages of C++?
Answer -> C++ is an object-oriented programming language that was introduced to overcome the jurisdictions where C was lacking. 
By object-oriented we mean that it works with the concept of polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, object, and class.
Advantages of C++:

C++ is an OOPs language that means the data is considered as objects.
C++ is a multi-paradigm language; In simple terms, it means that we can program the logic, structure, and procedure of the program.
Memory management is a key feature in C++ as it enables dynamic memory allocation
It is a Mid-Level programming language which means it can develop games, desktop applications, drivers, and kernels

2. What are the different data types present in C++?

3. Define ‘std’?
‘std’ is also known as Standard or it can be interpreted as a namespace. 
The command “using namespace std” informs the compiler to add everything under the 
std namespace and inculcate them in the global namespace. This all inculcation of global namespace benefits
us to use “cout” and “cin” without using “std::_operator_”.
For more information, refer to namespace and std.

4. What are references in C++?
Answer -> When a variable is described as a reference it becomes an alias of the already existing variable. 
In simple terms, a referenced variable is another named variable of an existing variable keeping in mind that 
changes made in the reference variable will be reflected in the already existing variable. A reference variable 
is preceded with a ‘&’ symbol.
