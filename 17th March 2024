JavaScript is a client site scripting language which makes our web pages interactive. 

Java Script + Node Js  → Backend.

We can use JavaScript in frontend (for creating alerts) and also in backend.

In Frontend we can use JavaScript in two ways:

1. Using <script><script> tag. 
2. Make a different file. script.js and copy the content in script.js file. Also link script.js in index.html file.

Node js is a v8 engine of JavaScript.

A scripting language is a type of programming language that is typically interpreted rather than compiled. This means that the execution takes place line by line, without the need for a separate compilation.

1. **Server-side scripting languages**: These operate on the server to generate responses for client requests, primarily to create dynamic content for web pages. Examples include PHP, Java, Ruby, Python, C#, and Go.
2. **Client-side scripting languages**: These execute scripts directly in the client’s web browser without the need for server interaction. They handle tasks such as data validation, handling UI components, and managing dynamic elements like navigation tools. Examples include JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, and AJAX1.

Here’s an example of a script written in Python, a popular scripting language:

```python
# This is a simple Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console
print("Hello, World!")

```

When you run this script, the Python interpreter reads and executes the command line by line. In this case, it prints the text “Hello, World!” to the console. This illustrates the simplicity and ease of use of scripting languages for automating tasks and manipulating data.

Variables in JavaScript → Variables in JavaScript are like containers where we can store any data.

**Q.** What is ECMAScript ?

Answer → ECMAScript is a standard that guides how scripting languages like JavaScript should be written and work.

ECMAScript is like a rulebook for how languages like JavaScript should work. It is like a grammar book for JavaScript. It tells what words (syntax) and sentence structures (semantics) are allowed in JavaScript.

When we say browser supports ECMAScript, it means the browser understands the rules of this book and can correctly understand and run JavaScript code written according to these rules.

Variables in JavaScript → Variables are like containers in JavaScript that stores a value. That value can be either a number, or string, or floating point number, or a JavaScript object.

Var vs Let in JavaScript.

1. Var is globally scoped while let and const are blocked scope.
