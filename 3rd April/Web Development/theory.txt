Express.js is a web framework for Node.js. It's used for building web applications and APIs. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

Here are some key points about Express.js:

- **Simplicity**: Express.js is very simple to use and allows you to set up a server with just a few lines of code.

- **Middleware**: Express.js uses middleware functions that can execute any code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function in the stack.

- **Routing**: It provides a robust routing system. Routes are the different paths that users can navigate to in your application.

- **Integration**: Express.js integrates seamlessly with other JavaScript libraries and frameworks, and is particularly known for its great integration with MongoDB and other databases.

- **Performance**: Express.js does not add any extra overhead, and thus it's quite fast when it comes to server-side processing.

- **Community Support**: Express.js has a large community of developers which results in constant updates and bug fixes.

In summary, Express.js is a powerful tool for creating web applications and APIs, and is widely used in the industry due to its simplicity, flexibility, and performance. It's a great choice when building production-grade applications.
