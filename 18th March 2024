// String is immutable.
console.log(a)
console.log(a[0]) // Accessing the particular character.
// console.log(a[5]) // Undefined.

console.log(a.length) // It will tell the length of array.


// Template literal.
// Problam.
let real_name = "Harry"
let friend = "Rohan"
console.log("His name is " + real_name + " and his friends name is " + friend)
// Solution using template literal.
console.log(`His name is ${real_name} and his friend's name is ${friend} ` ) // Template Literal.

b = `Devansh"u` // Using string literal we can insert something like this within any datatype.
console.log(b)

//If we do not want to use string literal, we can then use escape sequence characters.
b = "Devans\"hu"
console.log(b)

b = "Devansh\nu" // Escape sequence to add a new line.
console.log(b)

// There are some string properties and methods.
let c = "Shivam"
console.log(c.toUpperCase()) // The string will get converted in uppercase.
console.log(c.toLowerCase())
console.log(c.length)
console.log(c.slice(1,4)) // Slice operation on string but here, the last index will be excluded.
console.log(c.slice(2)) // From 2 to all characters.
console.log(c.replace("Sh", "77")) // 1st occurence will get replaced.

// String concatenation.
let d = "Devanshu"
let e = "Jha"
console.log(d+" "+e) // String concatenation.
console.log(d.concat(e)) // String Concatenation.
console.log(d.concat(e, "Chips")) // String Concatenation.

let name = "Devanshu"
console.log(name)

//Strings immutability concept.

console.log(str); // Outputs: "Hello"

let str = "Hello"; // Re assignation is possible.

console.log(str); // Outputs: "Jello"

console.log(a.startsWith("Har")) // It will tell whether a string will starts with har.

/*
Excercise 10.
Business Name Generator.
Create a business name generator by combining list of adjectives and shop name and another word.

List of adjactives - Here we can not use arrays. 
Crazy
Amazing
Fire 

Shop name:
Engine
Foods
Garments

Another word:
Bros
Limited
Hub

We need to take one name from adjective, one from shop name and one from another words. We do not need to use arrays.

Tutorial 63 Arrays in JavaScript.

// Array is collection of multiple datatypes within javascript. Here we can add numbers, String or objects also. 

let arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
console.log(arr)
console.log(arr.length)

// Arrays are mutable so we can change them. But strings are immutable.
arr[0] = 5666
console.log(arr, typeof arr)

// We can convert array into string usint toString function.
console.log(arr.toString())

console.log(arr.join(" and ")) // Whereever we had comma, "and" will come here.

console.log(arr.pop())
arr.push(100)
console.log(arr)

console.log(arr.shift()) // It takes the first array element and then return it.
console.log(arr)

console.log(arr.unshift("Jack"))
console.log(arr)
