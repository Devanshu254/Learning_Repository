Today, I have studied aptitude and I have revised the lectures which has been studied yesterday. 
Tomorrow I will cover new topics with new lectures.

One LeetCode Question.
class Solution {
public:
    int mostWordsFound(vector<string>& sentences) {
        int longest_sentence = INT_MIN;
        int n = sentences.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;++i) {
            int count = 1;
            for(int j=0;j<sentences[i].size();++j) {
                if(sentences[i][j] == ' ') {
                    count++;
                }else {
                    continue;
                }
            }
            longest_sentence = max(longest_sentence, count);
        }
        return longest_sentence;
    }
};
