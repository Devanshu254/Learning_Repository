1. What are the differences between Java and JavaScript? 
Java is a statically-typed, compiled programming language designed for building more complex applications.
It requires writing more boilerplate code but offers greater control over system resources.
JavaScript is a dynamically-typed, interpreted scripting language primarily used for enhancing interactivity 
and functionality in web pages.

Java applications run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can operate on any device or operating system that has the JVM installed.
JavaScript code is executed in web browsers and can also run on servers via Node.js.
