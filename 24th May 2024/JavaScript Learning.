1. What are the differences between Java and JavaScript? 
Java is a statically-typed, compiled programming language designed for building more complex applications.
It requires writing more boilerplate code but offers greater control over system resources.
JavaScript is a dynamically-typed, interpreted scripting language primarily used for enhancing interactivity 
and functionality in web pages.
