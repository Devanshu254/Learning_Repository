Q1. In HTML, why do we use Doctype?
Answer: The <!DOCTYPE> declaration specifies the document type and version of HTML being used. It ensures that the browser renders the page correctly by following the appropriate standards.
**Q2. What is the purpose of the `<head>` tag in HTML?**

**Answer**:  It basically includes all the meta tags which are basically used for SEO. It can also include external links like our Script Files and CSS files.
**Q3. Where should we link our JavaScript file in HTML: inside the `<head>` tag or just before the closing `<body>` tag?**

**Answer:** It’s better to place the JavaScript link just before the closing **`</body>`** tag. This ensures that the DOM (Document Object Model) is fully loaded before executing any JavaScript code. If placed in the **`<head>`** tag, the DOM elements may not be available yet.
