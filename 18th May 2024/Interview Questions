Q1. In HTML, why do we use Doctype?
Answer: The <!DOCTYPE> declaration specifies the document type and version of HTML being used. It ensures that the browser renders the page correctly by following the appropriate standards.
**Q2. What is the purpose of the `<head>` tag in HTML?**

**Answer**:  It basically includes all the meta tags which are basically used for SEO. It can also include external links like our Script Files and CSS files.
**Q3. Where should we link our JavaScript file in HTML: inside the `<head>` tag or just before the closing `<body>` tag?**

**Answer:** It’s better to place the JavaScript link just before the closing **`</body>`** tag. This ensures that the DOM (Document Object Model) is fully loaded before executing any JavaScript code. If placed in the **`<head>`** tag, the DOM elements may not be available yet.
**Q4. What if I want to put the JavaScript link in the `<head>` tag, even though it accesses DOM elements?**

**Answer:** You can use the **`defer`** attribute. When applied to the **`<script>`** tag, it tells the browser to download the JavaScript file but execute it only after the DOM has finished parsing.
Q5. What’s the difference between placing the script tag in the <head> and <body>?
Answer: When placed in the <head>, the script file is downloaded immediately, but execution waits until after the DOM is fully parsed. In the <body>, the script is downloaded and executed sequentially as it appears in the HTML.
Q6. What does the async attribute do on the script tag?
Answer: The async attribute allows the browser to download the script file asynchronously (without blocking HTML parsing). Once downloaded, it executes immediately, even if the DOM is not fully parsed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, so use it carefully.
Q7. Can we create any custom element like your name is Devanshu so, can we create an HTML or anything like with any name?

Answer → CSS Just ignores if something is not valid but in HTML you can create any Tag name, you can create Devanshu or any other tag name.
