// You have to write a nodejs program to clear cutter inside a directory and organize the contents of that directory into different folders.

// Eg:
// 1. Name.jpg, 2.name.png, 3. this.pdf, 4. harry.zip, 5. rohan.zip, 6. cat.jpg.
// Jpg naam ka eak folder ban jayega aur name.jpg uske ander aa jayegi.
// jpg/name.jpg,jpg/cat.jpg. png/png,pdf/..

// There are two ways to solve this problem.
// 1. See how many extensions are there within this folder. Then create the folder for that files and then insert files within that folder.
// 2.
